# The functionality for the program is fairly minimal because I am still
# in the process of implementing the scoring and statistics tracking
# mechanism, but I have cleaned up all of the errors that were in the code
# and although a couple functions are commented out, it so far is doing
# what I would like it to do which is to create two player objects and
# then ask for their names. It will be relatively simple to implement the
# scoring mechanism that I have chosen, but if in the future I have more
# time to increase the complexity of the scoring mechanism, I will do so.
