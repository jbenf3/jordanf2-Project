Habit: Read the error output

Because I am not very familiar with classes in Python (even after the
lecture) and I found myself struggling to implement a simple class in this
project, I encountered many errors including a NameError when I was using
the input() function so that the user could type in the name of the
players. I Googled this error message and found that the input() function
actually evaluates what is inside of the parentheses, whereas raw_input()
just assigns what is inside of the parentheses to the variable. I also got
rid of some of the issues with dividing by zero in my class definition by
not defining the first serve percentage under the init heading but rather
as a member function of the class.
