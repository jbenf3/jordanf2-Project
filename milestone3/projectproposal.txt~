Tennis Match Tracker

What does your project accomplish?
This project will be a comprehensive program that takes in tennis match
statistics input by a user (simple inputs like whether the first serve
went in, whether the second serve went in, how many shots the rally was,
whether the point ended on a winner, a forced error, or an unforced error)
and then will present this information in an elegant and informative
graphical manner after the match has finished. For possible extensions,
this could be made into a more user interactive program where instead of
typing, the user could simply click buttons that would correspond to
events that happen in a point in tennis.Another possible extension is to
display statistics in real-time (as in after every point).

What inputs will it accept?
The initial version of this program will just accept letters and numbers
typed in by the user - the program will do essentially all of the legwork
behind the scenes to analyze the data that the user enters over the course
of a tennis match. The specific inputs are:
   - type of match (2 out of 3 sets, 3 out of 5 sets, etc.)
   - scoring type (ad or no-ad)
   - player 1 name
   - player 2 name
   **throughout the course of the match, the user will repeatedly be asked
   for the following information**
   - first serve in/out
   - second serve in/out (if applicable)
   - number of shots in the point
   - whether the point ended on a winner, forced error, or unforced error
   - what type of shot the point was ended on
The data will initially be stored in variables, but in order to display
certain statistics about serve percentages over the course of a match or
number of winners over the course of a match, information will need to be
placed into arrays where the divisions match up with the number of games
played in the match.
